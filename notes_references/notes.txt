Keep in mind:
	Figure out what the core elements are. Strip down game. Build core elements. Go from there.
	Web of dependencies.
	Restrictions. Restrictions.
	MAKE THE GAME REWARDING.

Foundational ideas:
	Have some types citizens be "pathways" to other types citizens.
	Actual infrastructure.
	Make it a factory game, kinda.
	Materials/Resources.

In between:
	Citizens keep coming.
	People leave.
	Early game stuff is not built very well, but tends to become backbone.
	Rating system.
	Larger scale? Infinite?
	Existing support materials on planet.
	Have the player have needs.
	Start with limited supplies.
	More types of citizens with more variety and overlap.
	Build infrastructure for conflicting needs.

Non-Foundational ideas:
	If there is nowhere to land the player gets punished in some way. Maybe the lander crashes after flying around for a while.
	The higher the rating of the town, the more often landers come.
	With extremely low ratings landers only come if there is a landing area, and only landers from this planet.
	Different levels of landing pads for different size ships.
	Talk to citizens.
	Play as different species.
	Repair robots.
	Plants as citizens.
	Robots are built by player.
	Items go bad maybe?
	Temporary housing. Quick housing for citizens inbetween homes?
	Make NPCs wander around complaining when they don't have beds.
	Extra happiness from certain things.

@Blue and @Pixer helped with this.
